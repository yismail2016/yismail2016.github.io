                <p>Drake's album is fire and he sold out more albums than Beyonce to date.
                Drake has gone gold in under 24 hours with over 600,000 copies sold deomestically. 
                He has also managed to go Platinum in only 3 days and the hard copy of the album didn't come out until a week and a half later and he has been able to top the sales charts easily.
                Drake has grossed a net worth of 100 million dollars and right now sits at the 5th richest person in rap in the Forbes Five following P.Diddy, Dr. Dre, Jay-Z, Birdman, and finally Drake.</p>
